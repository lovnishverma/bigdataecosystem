# **Apache Spark Overview**

## **1. Introduction to Apache Spark**

- **Overview**:
  - **Apache Spark** is an open-source distributed computing system designed for high-speed data processing and analytics on large datasets.
  - Unlike traditional MapReduce frameworks (e.g., Hadoop), Spark utilizes in-memory computation, making it faster for processing both batch and real-time data.

- **Key Features**:
  - **In-memory processing** for faster data access.
  - **Unified analytics engine** for batch and stream processing.
  - Supports multiple languages: **Scala**, **Python**, **Java**, and **R**.
  - Built-in libraries for **SQL**, **streaming**, **machine learning**, and **graph processing**.
  - Highly **scalable** and **fault-tolerant**.

## **2. Introduction to DataFrames in Apache Spark**

- **What are DataFrames?**
  - A **DataFrame** is a distributed collection of data organized into named columns, making it similar to a table in a relational database or a DataFrame in Python's pandas.
  - DataFrames are optimized for performance in Spark through the **Catalyst Optimizer**.
  
- **Key Operations on DataFrames**:
  - **Creation**: You can create DataFrames from various data sources like CSV, JSON, Parquet, or even programmatically from existing RDDs.
  - **Transformations**: DataFrames support transformations like **filtering**, **grouping**, and **joining**.
  - **Actions**: Actions like **count()**, **show()**, **collect()**, etc., trigger the computation on the data.
  
  Example:
  ```scala
  val data = Seq(("Alice", 30, "HR"), ("Bob", 25, "Engineering"), ("Charlie", 35, "Finance"))
  val df = data.toDF("Name", "Age", "Department")
  df.show()
  ```

## **3. Introduction to Scala for Apache Spark**

- **Why Scala?**
  - **Spark is written in Scala**, making it the most natural and efficient language to work with Spark.
  - Scala is a **concise**, **functional programming** language that fits well with Spark's functional-style APIs.
  
- **Basic Syntax Example**:
  ```scala
  val numbers = List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
  val doubled = numbers.map(_ * 2)
  println(doubled)
  ```

- **Running Spark with Scala**:
  - Start a Spark session in **Scala** (via Spark shell or a Scala-based notebook):
  ```bash
  spark-shell
  ```

## **4. Introduction to Spark SQL**

- **Need for Spark SQL**:
  - Spark SQL allows you to interact with structured data using SQL queries, offering a **declarative interface** for data manipulation.
  - It provides optimization capabilities through the **Catalyst optimizer** and allows for **seamless integration** with other Spark components.
  - Spark SQL can **connect to Hive** and execute legacy SQL queries on big data.
  
- **Key Components**:
  - **SQL Queries**: You can execute SQL queries on DataFrames and temporary views.
  - **Hive Integration**: Use Spark SQL to query data in **Hive**.
  - **Optimizations**: It benefits from **Catalyst**, which optimizes queries for performance.

## **5. Hands-On: Spark SQL**

### **Objective**:  
Learn how to create DataFrames, load data from various sources, perform transformations, and execute SQL queries.

### **Steps**:

#### **Step 1: Setup Spark Environment**
1. **Install Spark** and configure the environment.
2. **Start Spark** in **Master Mode**:
   ```bash
   $SPARK_HOME/sbin/start-master.sh
   ```
3. **Start Spark** in **Worker Mode**:
   ```bash
   $SPARK_HOME/sbin/start-worker.sh spark://localhost:7077
   ```
4. Open the **Spark shell**:
   ```bash
   spark-shell
   ```

#### **Step 2: Create DataFrames**
- Create a **DataFrame** from a simple list:
  ```scala
  val data = Seq(
    ("Alice", 30, "HR"),
    ("Bob", 25, "Engineering"),
    ("Charlie", 35, "Finance")
  )
  
  val df = data.toDF("Name", "Age", "Department")
  df.show()
  ```

#### **Step 3: Perform Transformations and SQL Queries**
- **Create Temporary View**:
  ```scala
  df.createOrReplaceTempView("employees")
  ```
  
- **SQL Query**:
  ```scala
  val result = spark.sql("SELECT Department, COUNT(*) as count FROM employees GROUP BY Department")
  result.show()
  ```

#### **Step 4: Save Transformed Data**
- Save the result of a transformation:
  ```scala
  result.write.option("header", "true").csv("hdfs://localhost:9000/data/output/employees")
  ```

#### **Step 5: Load Data from Various Sources**

1. **Load Data from HDFS**:
   ```scala
   val df = spark.read.option("header", "true").csv("hdfs://localhost:9000/data/crimerecord/police/police.csv")
   df.show()
   ```

2. **Load Data from Local Filesystem**:
   ```scala
   val dfLocal = spark.read.option("header", "true").csv("file:///path/to/local/data.csv")
   dfLocal.show()
   ```
